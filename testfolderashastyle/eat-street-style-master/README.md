# eat-street-solo
Stand-alone version of eatstreet app using their npm package - part of GWU full stack web dev program.

To be integrated in to our project "Netflix&Chill" - this piece allows one to get a list of food delivery option available locally.

For now, not optimally, the npm/api key is still in the code, rather than a separate .env location.

Note also uses the reverse-lookup pacakge - given latitude & longitude on the client side, return zip code on the server for 
restaurant lookup.

similar to eat-street-solo - but with bootstrap cyborg 

'npm install' must be run to install packages before executing
